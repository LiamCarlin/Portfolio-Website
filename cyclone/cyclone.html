                    Cyclone is a 3-pound featherweight class BattleBot engineered for high-speed, high-impact combat. Designed and built by Liam Carlin during his junior year at Winchester High School, Cyclone was developed to compete in the National Havoc Robot League (NHRL). With a powerful vertical spinner weapon, durable construction, and a precision control system, Cyclone embodies a relentless offensive strategy while maintaining exceptional defensive resilience.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Design Journey: From Concept to Combat</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Cyclone was born from a series of creative iterations and design challenges. Initially, the design was a spinning disk on wheels with no steering system, focused purely on acceleration and collision power. The original idea was to allow the bot to spin faster and faster until it collided with an opponent. However, this design lacked control, resulting in unpredictable movements and the inability to aim strikes effectively.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Design Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control Limitations: The original concept lacked any steering mechanism, making it difficult to target opponents intentionally.</li>
                    <li>Gyroscopic Instability: Early prototypes explored a horizontal spinning weapon inspired by the renowned heavyweight BattleBot Tombstone. However, the gyroscopic forces from the horizontal spinner made the robot unstable, often causing it to tip or lose balance.</li>
                    <li>Durability Concerns: The early iterations used carbon fiber-infused plastic, which proved insufficient when tested against other spinning weapon bots. The material could not withstand direct impacts effectively.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="project-description">
                    Cyclone’s structure is built around a robust yet lightweight frame optimized for both offensive and defensive strategies.

                <h3>Weapon System: High-Speed Vertical Spinner</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design: Cyclone’s primary weapon is a vertical spinner disk, engineered for maximum kinetic energy transfer.</li>
                    <li>Speed: Powered by a brushless motor and electronic speed controller (ESC), the weapon spins at an impressive 16,500 RPM.</li>
                    <li>Drive Mechanism: The weapon is belt-driven, allowing efficient power transfer from the motor while minimizing motor stress.</li>
                    <li>Material: Currently, the spinner is constructed from high-strength TPU but will be upgraded to aluminum for better impact durability.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why a Vertical Spinner?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct Upward Force: Can flip or destabilize opponents upon contact.</li>
                    <li>Focused Damage: The concentrated point of impact delivers maximum energy to a smaller area.</li>
                    <li>Gyroscopic Stability: Compared to horizontal spinners, vertical spinners reduce gyroscopic destabilization, making the bot more balanced.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Drivetrain and Mobility: Tank Drive System</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Cyclone uses a tank drive system for precise movement and control. Each wheel is powered independently by a brushed DC motor paired with a planetary gearbox for enhanced torque and durability.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drive Control: Controlled via an RC transmitter with dual-stick control (tank-style). Each stick corresponds to an independent wheel, allowing fine control over turning, spinning, and forward/backward movement.</li>
                    <li>Wheels: The wheels are made from TPU for impact absorption and better traction on various surfaces.</li>
                    <li>Drive Type: Direct drive, ensuring fewer components and a compact, responsive design.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Mobility Advantages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Precise Maneuvering: Tank drive allows for pivot turns and fine adjustments.</li>
                    <li>Reduced Complexity: Fewer mechanical components reduce potential points of failure.</li>
                    <li>Quick Recovery: Cyclone can reorient quickly if flipped or knocked off balance.</li>

                    <li>Material: The current frame is 3D printed using TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). TPU was chosen for its shock-absorbing properties and lightweight nature, but future iterations will use milled aluminum for increased rigidity and damage resistance.</li>
                    <li>Armor Layers: Cyclone features steel upper and lower plates, adding a protective shield against direct hits to the internals.</li>
