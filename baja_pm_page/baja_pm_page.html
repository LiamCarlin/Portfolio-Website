                            Olin Baja is on track to become one of the most competitive and innovative collegiate engineering teams in the country. We're continuing to push toward more data integration, smarter testing, and more inclusive participation. But beyond competition, what excites me most is that we've built something sustainable ‚Äî a team structure, a culture, and a workflow that will continue to thrive long after my time as Project Manager.
